This data science project is an "Analysis of Earthquake Data" that  utilizes web scraping in R, data processing and organization, data visualization (graphs, histograms), machine learning, and data anlysis. My tutorial scraps, processes, and analyzes the Kaggle dataset "Significant Earthquakes, 1965-2016." You can access the original dataset here: https://www.kaggle.com/usgs/earthquake-database/data.

The project output is an .rmd file, which stands for R-Markdown. To view the project, you have to download RStudio and use it to open the RMD file. Download it here: https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/.

Enjoy the tutorial!
